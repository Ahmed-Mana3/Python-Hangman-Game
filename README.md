Python üêç Hangman Game üï∫

Welcome to the Python Hangman Game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, ensuring varied gameplay.
- **ASCII Art**: Visual representation of the hangman state enhances the user experience.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the game script to begin.
2. **Guess a Letter**: Input a single letter and press Enter.
3. **Feedback**:
   - If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct positions.
   - If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn, and you lose one life.
4. **Win/Lose**:
   - Win by guessing all the letters in the word before running out of lives.
   - Lose if the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed.
